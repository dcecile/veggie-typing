# Veggie Typing

This is a typing game where you try to grow as many vegetables as you can. Watch out for the diseases, and take care of the pollinators.

## Basic mechanics

- Give points if a vegetable is typed
- Give a penalty if a disease is not typed
- Freeze time if a pollinator is typed

## Potential game ideas

- Add colors and styles
- Disable/hide input until game started
- Pause game if click again
- Highlight partial matches in canvas
- Sometimes show multiple names on one line
- Animate when a name is typed
- Give a bonus for consequtive words typed without using backspace
- Multiple rounds with progressive difficulty
